# CLUES.md

This file provides guidance to Clues Code when working with code in this repository.

## Detected stack
- Languages: Rust.
- Frameworks: none detected from the supported starter markers.

## Verification
- Run Rust verification from `rust/`: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`
- `src/` and `tests/` are both present; update both surfaces together when behavior changes.

## Repository shape
- `rust/` contains the Rust workspace and active CLI/runtime implementation.
- `src/` contains source files that should stay consistent with generated guidance and tests.
- `tests/` contains validation surfaces that should be reviewed alongside code changes.

## Working agreement
- Prefer small, reviewable changes and keep generated bootstrap files aligned with actual repo workflows.
- Keep shared defaults in the generated project settings file and reserve machine-local overrides for the generated local settings file.
- Do not overwrite existing `CLUES.md` content automatically; update it intentionally when repo workflows change.
